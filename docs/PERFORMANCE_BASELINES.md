# Performance Baselines

Performance claims must name the measured seam, fixture, build profile,
environment, and excluded work. Do not compare a parser-only number with a
GPU-present or end-to-end file-open number.

## `silicate_runtime_open_v1`

Recorded on 2026-09-01 with:

- Windows 11 Pro `10.0.26200`
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 6 cores / 12 logical processors
- Rust `1.95.0` (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)
- release profile

Fixture:

- file: `Art_SystemPet_Default.procreate`
- bytes: `169646073`
- SHA-256: `D34D8594BC3880549D06411123DF28237CF5ADAA58CBF9206C287E46AD189E73`
- parsed layers including masks and excluding groups: `208`

Command:

```powershell
cargo run --release -p silicate-runtime --example benchmark_open -- `
  'C:\Users\Rizum\iCloudDrive\Procreate\Art_SystemPet_Default.procreate' 10
```

The tool reads the file before timing, performs one excluded warmup, then
creates a fresh runtime for each measured iteration. The timed seam includes
in-memory ZIP central-directory parsing, `Document.archive` extraction,
NSKeyedArchive decoding, document storage, snapshot projection, and creation of
the bounded `DocumentOpened` event result.

Results:

| Metric | Time |
| --- | ---: |
| Minimum | 4.006 ms |
| Median | 5.537 ms |
| Mean | 5.708 ms |
| Maximum | 7.658 ms |

Excluded work:

- disk read and memory mapping;
- layer chunk decompression;
- WGPU device, atlas, texture, and pipeline creation;
- compositor rendering and presentation;
- egui or GPUIX layout, paint, and input;
- export and platform integration.

Treat a change as suspicious when the same-machine, same-fixture median moves
by more than both ordinary run-to-run noise and 10%. Re-run before diagnosing;
this initial baseline does not yet define the end-to-end CanvasHost gate.

## Missing Baselines

The following remain required before replacing the production presentation
adapter:

- end-to-end file open to first presented canvas;
- layer visibility command to presented frame;
- pan and zoom frame time under physical input;
- animation playback frame pacing;
- working-set and GPU-memory peaks;
- still and video export throughput;
- minimize/restore and close-during-work behavior.
